# Data-Science-2016
This is my final project for the data science course I did in December 2016. The challenge was to analyse data relating to medical admissions of diabetic patients and use unsupervised and supervised learning to determine a classifier for readmission.
A correlation was found between an increase in the insulin dose and readmission. Similarly with a decrease in the insulin dose.
Libraries used: numpy, pandas, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn
