# Data-Science-2016
This is my final project for the data science course I did in December 2016 with Cambridge Spark. The challenge was to analyse data relating to medical admissions of diabetic patients and use unsupervised and supervised learning to determine a classifier for readmission.
A correlation was found between an increase in the insulin dose and readmission. Similarly with a decrease in the insulin dose.
Libraries used were numpy, pandas, seaborn, plotly and scikit-learn.
